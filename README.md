# Collaborative Todo App Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design of a collaborative todo application. The app allows multiple users to add, view, and manage tasks with due dates, descriptions, and additional information. The core features will be developed incrementally, starting with a basic todo list.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Create a collaborative todo application that allows multiple users to manage and share tasks.
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Understand the fundamentals of web development.
  - Gain experience with frontend and backend development.
  - Learn about databases and how to manage data.
  - Implement user authentication and authorization.
  - Develop real-time collaborative features.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Basic Features (Phase 1)
- **User Registration and Login:** Allow users to create accounts and log in.
- **Add Todo Items:** Users can add tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **View Todo Items:** Display a list of tasks added by the user.
- **Edit/Delete Todo Items:** Allow users to modify or remove tasks.

### 3.2 Intermediate Features (Phase 2)
- **Due Dates:** Users can add due dates to tasks.
- **Task Lists:** Users can create task lists to organize items.
- **Collaboration:** Share task lists with other users.

### 3.3 Advanced Features (Phase 3)
- **Notifications:** Send reminders for upcoming due dates.
- **Timeline View:** Visualize tasks on a timeline.
- **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time collaboration features.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Framework: React (optional for learning modern JS frameworks)
- **Backend:**
  - Language: Python or JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Framework: Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js)
- **Database:**
  - SQLite (for simplicity)
  - MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for more advanced features)
- **Authentication:**
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-time Communication:**
  - WebSockets (optional for advanced features)

## 5. Architecture

### Frontend
- **Components:** 
  - Login/Register Form
  - Task List
  - Task Item
  - Task Form (for adding/editing tasks)
- **State Management:** 
  - Use React's useState/useContext for managing the state (optional).

### Backend
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/register` (POST): Register a new user.
  - `/login` (POST): Authenticate a user.
  - `/tasks` (GET, POST): Fetch all tasks, Add a new task.
  - `/tasks/:id` (PUT, DELETE): Update or delete a task.

### Database Schema
- **Users Table:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `username` (unique)
  - `password_hash`
- **Tasks Table:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `due_date`
  - `user_id` (foreign key)

## 6. Development Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Todo List
- **Step 1:** Set up the development environment.
- **Step 2:** Implement user registration and login.
- **Step 3:** Develop the basic task management features.
- **Step 4:** Build the frontend to interact with the backend.
- **Step 5:** Test the application for core functionality.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Features
- **Step 1:** Extend the task model to include due dates.
- **Step 2:** Implement task lists and sharing functionality.
- **Step 3:** Enhance the frontend to support new features.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Step 1:** Implement notification system.
- **Step 2:** Create a timeline view for tasks.
- **Step 3:** Add real-time collaboration using WebSockets.

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Data Validation:** Validate all input data on both frontend and backend.
- **Authentication:** Use secure methods for password storage and user authentication.
- **Authorization:** Ensure that users can only access and modify their own data.

## 8. Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for individual functions and components.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate user actions to test the entire workflow.

## 9. Deployment

- **Environment:** Deploy on a platform like Heroku or Vercel for easy hosting.
- **Configuration:** Use environment variables for sensitive information.
- **Monitoring:** Implement basic monitoring and logging to track app performance.
